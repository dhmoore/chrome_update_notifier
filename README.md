# Chrome Update Notifier

## Requirements

* [Yo](https://github.com/sheagcraig/yo) (a customized version with your organization's logo is even cooler)

This is a script that is run via a Launch Agent periodically that will ensure that the currently running version of Google Chrome is the same as is on disk. If these differ, it will post a notification via Yo to ask the user to relaunch Google Chrome gracefully (preserving their precious tabs!).
